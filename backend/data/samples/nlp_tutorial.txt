Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, 
artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It focuses on the interaction between computers 
and human language, particularly how to program computers to process and analyze large 
amounts of natural language data.

Key NLP Tasks:
1. Tokenization - Breaking text into words or subwords
2. Part-of-Speech Tagging - Identifying grammatical roles
3. Named Entity Recognition - Finding names, places, organizations
4. Sentiment Analysis - Determining emotional tone
5. Machine Translation - Converting text between languages

Modern NLP relies heavily on deep learning models, particularly transformers like BERT, 
GPT, and their variants. These models have revolutionized the field by achieving 
state-of-the-art results on many benchmark tasks.
